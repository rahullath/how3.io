This simplified yet powerful benchmark system ensures retail investors clearly understand each project's fundamentals without crypto-jargon overload, perfectly aligning with your vision for how3.io.

Simplified how3 Score Calculation (0-100)
For each benchmark, convert the raw numbers to percentile rankings against all top 300 cryptos in that category:
Top 10% ‚Üí Score: 90-100 (Excellent)
10%-30% ‚Üí Score: 70-89 (Strong)
30%-70% ‚Üí Score: 40-69 (Average)
70%-90% ‚Üí Score: 20-39 (Weak)
Bottom 10% ‚Üí Score: 0-19 (Poor)
Final how3 Composite Score: (User Growth Score + Earnings Quality Score + Fair Value Score + Safety Score) / 4

Backend Developer Tasks (Simplified)
Primary Responsibilities:
Fetch specific raw data from TheGraph subgraphs or Dune Analytics SQL queries.
Ignore irrelevant crypto metrics (like social media followers, trading volume, etc.).
What exactly to fetch per benchmark:
Benchmark
Exactly what to Fetch (JSON format suggested)
User Growth
Daily active addresses, Daily transaction count, Daily bridge volume (if applicable)
Earnings Quality
Daily revenue (fees, subscriptions, node earnings), Monthly historical revenue for stability calculation
Fair Value
Current market cap, Annualized revenue, Token inflation/emission rates, Wallet distribution percentages (top 10 wallet holdings %)
Safety & Stability
Node/Validator count, Governance participation (%), Multisig wallet use (boolean), Regulatory audit passed (boolean), attack cost

Backend Tools & Methods:
GraphQL API calls: Fetch data from TheGraph
Dune Analytics Queries: Write basic SQL to fetch required aggregated data if unavailable on TheGraph.
Data Cleaning & Storage: Normalize & store data clearly in your database for frontend consumption.
Frontend Developer Tasks (Simplified)
Primary Responsibilities:
Receive structured benchmark scores (0-100) and explanatory metrics from backend API.
Display data cleanly according to design wireframe, with interactive UI,UX microinteractions etc
Data Format (JSON expected from backend):

{
  "crypto": "Ethereum",
  "category": "L1/L2",
  "benchmarks": {
	"userGrowth": 85,
	"earningsQuality": 78,
	"fairValue": 61,
	"safetyStability": 92
  },
  "compositeScore": 79,
  "explanation": {
	"userGrowth": "Ethereum has excellent adoption with X daily active users.",
	"earningsQuality": "Stable revenue from transaction fees of $Y daily.",
	"fairValue": "Market cap-to-revenue multiple is Zx, fair compared to industry.",
	"safetyStability": "Strong governance participation and decentralized validator set."
  }
}

Use simple charts (diamond indicators).

Show benchmark score clearly (0-100 scale) and color-code indicators based on scores:
0-39 (red), 40-69 (yellow), 70-100 (green)
Simple, explanatory tooltips to help users understand each score's meaning.

Tokenomics Highlight (Separate Section)
Simplified as a short, separate "Tokenomics Health" highlight box on each crypto page:
Inflation Rate (High/Moderate/Low)
Whale Concentration (Centralized/Fairly Distributed)
Emission/Burn Rate (Sustainable/Unsustainable)
This ensures tokenomics aren't overlooked and simplifies user comprehension without cluttering main benchmarks.

And finally 
üìä "Risk Volatility Chart" 
This metric tells retail investors clearly how much the price of a cryptocurrency might reasonably move up or down within a year based on historical data.
It's essentially a simplified volatility indicator, typically using historical annualized volatility:
üîç Calculation Method (Standardized & Simple):
Get Daily Closing Prices


Fetch the daily closing price data for the crypto asset for the past year (365 days).
Calculate Daily Returns


For each day, calculate the percentage daily return:
Daily Return = (Today's Closing Price - Yesterday's Closing Price) / Yesterday's Closing Price

Calculate Annualized Volatility
Compute standard deviation (œÉ) of these daily returns.
Annualize it (crypto markets typically trade ~365 days/year):
Annualized Volatility = Daily Standard Deviation √ó ‚àö365

Presenting the Metric Clearly
Convert to percentage and simplify:
Expected Annual Movement (%) = Annualized Volatility √ó 100
Show clearly as ¬± X%:
Example: "¬±42% expected annual movement."
Simple Example:
If Ethereum has a daily returns standard deviation of 2.2%:
Annualized Volatility = 2.2% √ó ‚àö365 ‚âà 42%
Clearly shown as:
"Ethereum's price may move ¬±42% in a year based on historical volatility."
Use coingecko/coinmarketcap api for this

Final json to share to front end is -

{
  "expectedAnnualMovement": 42,
  "currentPrice": 3000,
  "upsidePrice": 4260,
  "downsidePrice": 1740
}


how3.io: simple crypto analytics
Executive Summary
how3.io aims to revolutionize crypto investing by providing intuitive, jargon-free analytics focused on fundamental value rather than trading indicators.
